<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This Inventory Tracker & Management Project is a System Application designed for a particular Department in an Academic Institution. Tracking things manually and maintaining record in books may lead to manual errors and it increases human efforts.

So, “The Main Aim of this project is to reduce the stress of tracking by Substituting manpower with Automation.”

- This application provides the users to handle brands, categories, products, as well as report of the location of a particular item.

- The system merely records restocking data and provides warning of low stock at any location through notification at a specified interval.

- The system is used to track items and parts as they are imported to the Department, transferred between Classrooms, and finally if loaned to a person (staff or student).

- In future, we can develop android application for this project. So that status of inventory in stock can be seen on mobile phones anywhere in the world. This leads to easy and effective management of the inventory.
